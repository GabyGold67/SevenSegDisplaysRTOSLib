v1.3.0
_ Changed the relation between ClickCounter and TM74HC595LedTube classes, from Inheritance to Dependency, as the needed methods to achieve the change were progresively added.
_ getDspValMax() and getDspValMin() methods added, as the v2.0.0 update gave the possibility to instantiate different lenght displays, the minimum and maximum values representable by the display are now instantiation dependant. These methods give the resulting values for the integer range displayable.
_ Minor debug in counter class limit checking corrected.
_ Redundant code cleanup.
_ Documentation corrections and additions

v1.2.0 Methods simplification and debugging
Changes:
_ .setDigitsOrder() method newOrderSize parameter is removed as it didn't provided any needed information, minor incompatibility issues resulting in this change is preferred over keeping a backwards compatibility mechanism
_ _dspValMin and _dspValMax type changed from int to int32_t to ensure compatibility across different mcus and compilation settings.
_ All methods returning or using int values were changed to uint32_t where needed to ensure failsafe representation
Debugging:
_ Constructor dynamic memory asignation () misused, corrected.


v1.1.1 Avoided memory leaking by ensuring _digitPosPtr[] delete in the object destructor

v1.1.0 Added support for alternative wired modules, that use not direct correspondence between the bit position and the display port position
_ Added a mechanism to map de display port positions to bits position of the shift register, to seamlessly work with different wiring implementations made by different display providers.
_ Added the .setDigitsOrder() method to change that mapping as needed.
_ Added constants providing known mappings for some displays.
_ Added examples for 8-bits displays.
